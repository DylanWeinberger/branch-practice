				My name is Dylan Weinberger. I am just begining my journey towards becoming a web developer. Before deciding to enroll in the NYCDA Web Development intensive I worked in the inside sales department of CareerBuilder as well as the Customer Service department of both GrubHub and Groupon. I was hired by GrubHub when they were still a very small startup in Chicago. I loved my experience working in the startup atmosphere and gained valuable insight into what its like working for a tech company. I worked closely with some of the developers on our team helping to mold a user experince that we could be proud of.
